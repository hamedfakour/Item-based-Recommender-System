Recommender systems show users their favorite recommendations to help them make better choices.
One of the major problems faced by these systems is the cold start in which is the result of the lack of adequate information for making recommendations.
In this project a new model using Twitter data and sentiment analysis of tweet content that reduce the cold start problem of items.
According to the model, the Twitter data related to the items were initially collected and stored structurally and then all the tweets are scored and tagged using the sentiment analysis tool.
After feature extraction from the data, we used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and random forest to predict the results.
The proposed model makes recommender systems independent of available information and solves the cold start problem of items by examining usersâ€™ preferences via Twitter.
